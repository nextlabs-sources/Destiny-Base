Stack trace
-----------

java -cp <path to allatori.jar> com.allatori.StackTrace allatori-log.xml <file with obfuscated stack trace> <output file>

Rebuild allatori-log.xml
------------------------

# First build the system
ant -f build.xml allatori-log

You need to do this if you have added new classes or methods under
common/pf, client/pf, server/pf, server/dictionary, or
common/framework (i.e. the obfuscated jars). The log file provides a
mapping between the obfuscated class names and the originals and helps
to preserve line numbers information for stack traces (see above)

The log ensures that we don't have collisions between two classes in
different jars, but the same package (this is not usual in the real
world, but we break up packages into server, client, and common, so
we see it a lot).
